This assignment is made up of 4 functions:
* sum-up-numbers-simple(L, N), which takes a list of numbers and non-numbers. The predicate is true if N is the sum of the numbers not in nested lists in L.
* sum-up-numbers-general(L, N), which takes a list of numbers and non-numbers; the predicate returns true if N is the sum of ALL the numbers(including those in nested lists)in L. 
* min-above-min(L1, L2, N), in which L1 and L2 are both simple lists without nested lists, but may have non-numeric elemnts. The predicate is true if N is the minimum of the numbers in L1 that are larger than the smallest number in L2. If no numbers in L1 are larger than the smallest number in L2, the predicate is false.
* common-unique-elements(L1,L2, N), where L1 and L2 are general lists that may contain nested lists. The predicate is true if N is a simple list(a list without sub-lists) of the items that appear in both L1 and L2(including the sub-lists within).
